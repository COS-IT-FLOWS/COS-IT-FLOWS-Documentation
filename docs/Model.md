# Model

The “community sourced impact based early flood forecast and warning” is a paradigm shift from the conventional flood forecast approach to forefront the needs of the affected communities, stakeholders and decision makers, recommended by the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO, 2015). The approach provides a platform for interaction and sharing of real time information across a river basin to understand and foresee the impacts of an imminent extreme weather event  and (or) excessive dam releases/ failures under multiple user defined scenarios. This improves the efficiency of disaster preparedness and management mechanism and equips decision makers to foresee and issue necessary prior warnings and prepare (evacuation, rescue and relief) under multiple disaster scenarios to reduce the impacts.

## Approach

There is a lack of monitoring systems, impact based forecasts and large gaps in last mile connectivity that jeopardise the effectiveness of early warning systems in India. There are only 332 river locations where flood forecasts are issued in the country. Deficient high resolution flood inundation maps for various weather and river conditions and inadequate local flood action plans limit its further use not only to the affected communities but also to the Disaster Management Authorities. The issue becomes more complex in the small humid tropical rivers in the Western Ghats, where groundwater contribution in floods is significant but less understood. Most of the presently used hydrological models therefore underestimate flood volumes and fail to accommodate the higher time lags for peak runoff.

Our Community-Sourced Impact-based Flood Forecast and Early Warning System (CoS-it-FloWS), bridges the last mile connectivity and data gaps and provides innovative,inclusive solutions to address climate risks through:

+ empowering local communities to build hyper-local monitoring systems
+ developing hydrological models and impact-based warning systems
+ co-creating science-based solutions and decision support systems for flood risk reduction with communities
